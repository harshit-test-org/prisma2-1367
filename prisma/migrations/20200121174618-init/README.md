+// The `datasource` block is used to specify the connection to your DB.
+// Set the `provider` field to match your DB type: "postgresql", "mysql" or "sqlite".
+// The `url` field must contain the connection string to your DB.

+}
+// Other examples for connection strings are:
+// SQLite: url = "sqlite:./dev.db"
+// MySQL:  url = "mysql://johndoe:johndoe@localhost:3306/mydb"
+// You can also use environment variables to specify the connection string: https://pris.ly/prisma-schema#using-environment-variables
+
+// By adding the `generator` block, you specify that you want to generate Prisma's DB client.
+// The client is generated by runnning the `prisma generate` command and will be located in `node_modules/@prisma` and can be imported in your code as:
+// import { Prisma Client } from '@prisma/client'
+generator client {
+  provider = "prisma-client-js"
+}
+
+
+model User {
+  id String @id @default(cuid())
+  name String
+  age Int
+}
+
+// Next steps:
+// 1. Add your DB connection string as the `url` of the `datasource` block
+// 2. Run `prisma2 introspect` to get your data model into the schema (this will override this file and delete all comments!)
+// 3. Run `prisma2 generate` to generate Prisma Client JS
+// 4. Start using Prisma Client JS in your application
